# About Me
I'm a semi-pro traveler, burrito aficionado, Python scripter, and problem solver. Currently I'm pursuing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Florida and Stellenbosch University. Take a look at my [CV](/cv) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pSIRTswAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). Some of my interests include:

- numerical modeling
- high performance computing
- multidiscipline optimization
- non-linear finite element analysis
- material models 
- inflatable structures

<br />
My technical skill set, determination, and easy going personality all combine to make me one exceptional team player. 
Send me an email at [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) and let's work together on some thought-provoking problems.

I use PGP. My public key is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjekel/cjekel.github.io/master/assets/Charles.Jekel.asc).
