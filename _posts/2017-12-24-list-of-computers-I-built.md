### Why this list

Each computer I've assembled has served a very specific purpose and I don't want to forget them. I'm putting together this list of CPUs I've used before I forget!

There is some nostalgia with the process of selecting which computer hardware to use, where to buy, the assembly of the parts, and the first boot up. To be honest this has been one of my favorite hobbies throughout the years. It's been a great way to stay up to date with the latest hardware improvements.

I'll try to keep this list up to date, every time I put together a new computer!
