### Professional Experience

## Courses Taught
2017: [Python Programming]({{ "/" | relative_url  }}assets/PythonProgrammingEML6934.pdf) - 1 credit hour graduate course - [Syllabus]({{ "/" | relative_url  }}assets/eml6934_Python_Syllabus.pdf)

Created and taught the first Python Programming course in the MAE department at the University of Florida. The course goes from the basics of Python to covering the most popular scientific Python libraries in an effort to prepare graduate students for performing research in Python.

## UTC Aerospace Systems
2013 - 2014: Manufacturing Engineer  
2012: Manufacturing Engineer Intern
