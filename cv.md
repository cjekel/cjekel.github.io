### Professional Experience

## Courses Taught
2017: [Python Programming]({{ "/" | relative_url  }}assets/PythonProgrammingEML6934.pdf) - 1 credit hour graduate course - [Syllabus]({{ "/" | relative_url  }}assets/eml6934_Python_Syllabus.pdf) - [Course material](https://github.com/cjekel/Introduction-to-Python-Numerical-Analysis-for-Engineers-and-Scientist)

Created and taught the first Python Programming course in the MAE department at the University of Florida. The course covers topics from the basics of Python to the most popular scientific Python libraries in an effort to prepare graduate students to perform research in Python.

## Python Libraries
[pwlf](https://github.com/cjekel/piecewise_linear_fit_py): A library for fitting continuous piecewise linear functions to two dimensional data.

[tindetheus](https://github.com/cjekel/tindetheus): A Python application that allows users to build their own personalized machine learning models using computer vision. The models can automatically like users on Tinder, based on the user's own historical preference.

## UTC Aerospace Systems
2013 - 2014: Manufacturing Engineer  
2012: Manufacturing Engineer Intern  

Worked directly with all OEM final assembly lines to interface with Product Engineering on issues related to manufacturing. Participated on Integrated Product Development Teams to improve manufacturing processes associated with specialty aircraft seats (pilot, flight attendant, and observer) for commercial
platforms.

## University of Colorado - Colorado Springs
2010 - 2013: Student Assistant IV

All-purpose IT wizard. Graphic design guru.
